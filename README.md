# TABLEAU_SERVER_CLIENT

This is a series of Jupyter Notebooks that show common methods and applications of the #TableauServerClient Python3 library.

Be sure to rewire these notebooks to use the API token corresponding to your specific Tableau server.

Combining this with other automation workflows can automate a lot of the recurring maintence and validity checks associated with your Tableau server.


Good luck!!
